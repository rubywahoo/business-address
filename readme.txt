Add Business Address in settings screen, and echo throughout site with a shortcode.

== Description ==
There are no perfect ways to store this information in one place in your site, and to display it in many places. Some put it in the Theme Customizer, but this isn\'t the right place for this. Creating a widget is another approach but I find my self using them less and less. This plugin allows you to enter the information once, and display it throughout your site where you\'d like.

== Installation ==
Place bussiness_address folder in your plugins directory, and activate.
