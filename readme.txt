Add Business Address in settings screen, and echo throughout site with a shortcode.

== Description ==
Beta
There are no perfect ways to store this information in one place in your site, and to display it in many places. Some put it in the Theme Customizer, but this isn\'t the right place for this. Creating a widget is another approach but I find my self using them less and less. This plugin allows you to enter the information once, and display it throughout your site where you\'d like.

== Installation ==
Place business_address folder in your plugins directory, and activate.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: How to display in theme?
A: You can add a shortcode [business_address] in any page editor, or add directly in template with the do_shortcode() function.

Q: Can I just display part of my address?
A: As of now, the shortcode will display and fields saved in the settings page. Next release will contain shortcode attributes so you can display different items from the address in different places.
-- v 0.2 Allows you to use the phone number separately with the shortcode [business_address_phone]. This is also a link to the phone number.
